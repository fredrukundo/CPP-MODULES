# C++ Modules (00-09) Project

## Project Overview

This project covers the core concepts and advanced features of C++ through a series of 10 modules. Each module is designed to build upon the previous one, taking you from the basics of C++ to advanced topics like containers, memory management, and templates.

### Modules Breakdown

- **Module 00**:  
  This introductory module focuses on the differences between C and C++. It serves as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), covering foundational concepts like classes, objects, and encapsulation.

- **Module 01-08**:  
  These modules build upon OOP concepts and dive into more advanced features of C++, such as:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Operator overloading
  - Templates
  - Exception handling
  - Smart pointers
  - Resource management and efficient memory handling using the Standard Template Library (STL)

- **Module 09**:  
  This final module focuses on C++ containers. It provides an in-depth look into the Standard Template Library (STL) containers such as vectors, lists, maps, and sets. You'll explore how these containers work, how to use them effectively, and their performance implications.

## Skills Gained

By completing these modules, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Learn advanced C++ features and how to apply them in real-world applications
- Master the use of containers and efficient memory management techniques
- Develop a solid foundation in using the Standard Template Library (STL)

This project equips you with the knowledge and tools to confidently use C++ for software development, from small-scale projects to complex applications.
